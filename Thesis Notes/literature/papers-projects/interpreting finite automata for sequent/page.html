This paper identifies key properties used to interpret automata and proposes a modified state-merging approach to learn variants of finite state automata.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Preliminaries<br/>
</b>Finite automata: models are variants of deterministic finite state automata. <br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Determenistic if there exists exactly one such path for every possible string<br/>
Learning approaches<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;1. Active learning<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;2. Algorithms based on the method of moments<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;3. Process mining<br/>
<br/>
State merging:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;create APTA (augmented prefix tree acceptor, tree shaped automoton for the input sample)<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;state merging algorith reduces the size of the automoton iteratively by reducingthe tree throughmerging pairs of states in the model and forcing the result to be determenistic.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;can make it cyclic!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Flexible state merging<br/>
</b>identify good merges. A merge is considered good, if the possible futures of two states are very similar. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Aspects of Interpretability in Automata<br/>
</b>1. Graphical representation<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;(cyclic, directed, labeled)<br/>
2. Transparent computation<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Each step of computation is the same for each symbol wi of an input sample w. It is possible to analyze training samples.<br/>
3. Generative automate<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Sampling from models helps to understand what it describes. Model checkers query properties in a formal way<br/>
4. Well studied automata (theory and practice)<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;composition, closure properties, sub-classes, etc. makes it easy to transfer knowledge to the domain. Model is often used to describe system logic and is accessible to a wide audience.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Use cases<br/>
</b>- Software Systems,<br/>
- Biological systems<br/>
- Driver behavior<br/>
- Wind speed prediction<br/>

<b>Summary<br/>
</b>This paper identifies key properties used to interpret automata and proposes a modified state-merging approach to learn variants of finite state automata. Interpretation of state automata is not feature inherent in the models or the algorithm, but is defined in the need and intention of the user. Interpretations draw from the set of properties: graphical representation, transparent computation, generative nature and the human understanding of automata theory. Machine learning serves as a tool for exploration to deal with epistemic uncertainty in observed ststems. The goal is not only to obtain a more compact view, but also to learn how to generalize from the observed data. Flexible state merging is introduced that seperates the symbolic representation from the objective function and heuristic, which helps stating the parameters<br/>
