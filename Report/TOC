1. Introduction
  Use case/ why -> what is the thesis topic.
  What -> what elements are used, where is this used more?
  Research objectives
  Main research question: Can one identify weaknesses in Android applications through feasible behavior model learning?
  RQ1: How can one extend model learning to be applicable to mobile applications?
  RQ2: How can one improve the feasibility of mobile application learning?
  RQ3: How can the learned model be used to assess the application's security?

2. Background and related work

    Speed and complexity of algorithms
  Mobile security: weaknesses

3. (RQ1) Mobile application modeling
    Alphabet completeness
    mobile parameters
    definition of state

4. (RQ2) Feasible learning
    Learning algorithms
    Action substitution
    Event-tree in OT

5. (RQ3) How can the learned model be used to assess the application's security?
    What vulnerabilities can be identified in a model
    Model enrichment
    Detection algorithms

6. Validation
    correctness
      From a self-made application
      From a set of known vulnerable applications
    Metrics
      Time comparison
