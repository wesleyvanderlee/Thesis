## Actions

Looking at the BSc. [project code](https://github.com/bunqcom/fsm-learner), trying to make it work shows that other applications are required to be installed (brew, nodeJS, Appium, maven). Configured a virtualized environment that contained these dependencies. The BSc. Project tool has 4 options:
    1. _learn_
    2. _alphabet:create_
    3. _alphabet:compose_
    4. _alphabet:destroy_
