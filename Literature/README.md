3. Complementing Model Learning with Mutation-Based Fuzzing
...In Complementing Model Learning with Mutation-Based Fuzzing Smetsers et al. compare conformance testing and mutation-based fuzzing methods as a way to find counterexamples for the minimally Adequate Teacher framework. This framework results from Angluin's L* algorithm, that enables one to treat software as a black-box and learn its state model. Conformance testing establishes an equivalence relation between current hypothesis and target. This equivalence is tested with a set of test queries and if one query fails, the hypothesis is refuted and can be refined.  Mutation-based fuzzing combined with a genetic evolutionary algorithm has also been used, where the evolutionairy algorithm asserts a fitness test to the queries. In this case, code coverage has been linked to the fitness test, meaning that the more code coverage a counterexample has, the fitter it is. For different problems, linear temproal logic and reachability, different fuzzing and model learning yield partially complementary results, which leads to believe that these orthogonal approaches aid each other.
