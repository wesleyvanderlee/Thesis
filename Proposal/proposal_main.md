## Research Questions

+ RQ1: How can we apply state machine learning to mobile applications?

+ RQ2: How can we best combine fuzzing and machine learning to hypothesize a functional state machine diagram?


+ RQ3: How can we apply fuzzing and learning on Android applications in a time-feasible way?

#### RQ1
	How to define a state (UI-wise)
	How to define equivalence (in case of dynamic representation), some scrape the UI-a-hrefs. 

#### RQ2
	Leads to the following model:

#### RQ3
	Should be fast enough.
